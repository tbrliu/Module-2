The repository consists of four parts: a data folder containing the raw data, a code folder containing all the codes for analysis, an image folder and a two-page pdf summary.
In the codes folder, you can get access to shiny_app.R, and all the codes for cleaning data, choosing the model, and diagnosing the model are in the rmd file. You can also check the html file for details.
